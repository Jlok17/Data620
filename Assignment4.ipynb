As an additional constraint, there should be at least one categorical variable available for each node (such as “Male” or “Female”; “Republican”, “Democrat,” or “Undecided”, etc.)"

The reason why this data was collected is that during that period, many national financial centre featured a foreign exchange market where banks traded foreign currency. As these markets were traded against their own domestic currency, this network shows a flow of trade and global market transaction between each nation and their economic power.  "

With that being said I can see a possibility with a couple of these top 10 foreign markets being colonies of one of the other top 10 markets as it has an establish connection from where the colony is to its empire. This would allow trade routes as well as currency familiarity to have an easier method of trust between the 2 countries. "
